## ACTION PLAN
- until April 29: create the dataset
Dependent variable: the number of patents per country (= national patent office)
Independent variables: 
Research& Development % of GDP, GDP per capita, R&D researchers per million of peopel, Unemployment ( % of total labor force), first fillings, education, STEM graduates/capacities, Transfer Ratios*, Export Share

*
•	What it is: This tells us how many first filings later become international patents, like ones filed in Europe.
•	Why it matters: Helps estimate future European patent filings based on past filings in other countries (like US or Japan).
