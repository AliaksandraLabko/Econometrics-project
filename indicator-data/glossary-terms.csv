Cross-country comparisons rely heavily on how far countries have used consistent field definitions. Detailed or aggregated information may not be fully comparable at the international level due to exclusions, double counting of students, partial data, etc. Also, differences in duration, intensity and degree of theoretical and applied content can bias comparisons between countries."

The Education 2030 Framework for Action endorses this indicator as a key benchmark for a government financing of education, allocating at least 4% to 6% of its GDP.",Government expenditure on education in a given financial year expressed as percentage of the GDP for the same financial year.,"Government expenditure on education by level of education, GDP data.","Data on education expenditure are provided by country governments through their responses to the annual UIS education survey and the UNESCO-OECD-Eurostat (UOE) data collection. The information used to complete the education expenditure questionnaire is typically sourced from annual financial reports issued by the Ministry of Finance/Economy or the Ministry of Education, or from national accounts books prepared by the National Statistical Office.  GDP data are sourced from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) online database, which is updated quarterly, typically in March, June, September, and December. The calculation of the indicator is based on the June update for the UIS biannual data disseminations.",By level of education.,"In general, high values of the indicator denote strong governmental commitment and prioritization to education. This often suggests substantial investments in infrastructure, teacher salaries, educational materials, and programmes, potentially enhancing education quality and access.  In contrast, low values may suggest that education is less prioritized compared to other sectors. Insufficient funding can result in challenges such as overcrowded classrooms, underpaid teachers, or limited access to education, especially for disadvantaged groups.  Values of at least 4% to 6% indicate that the country meets the benchmark endorsed by the Education 2030 Framework for Action.  When disaggregated by level of education, this indicator informs about the emphasis of government policy priority across levels of education.","The indicator should be calculated using consistent and actual data on total government expenditures on education and GDP. Government expenditure on education should encompass all relevant ministries and administrative levels to ensure comprehensive coverage. Additionally, differences between fiscal year and academic year budget periods must be accounted for to maintain accuracy and comparability.  The UIS defines the protocols and standards for government expenditure data reporting by countries, and maintains a global database on the indicator.  The World Bank ensure GDP data quality by using standards, methodologies, sources, definitions, and classifications that are internationally accepted.  (https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/906534-data-quality-and-effectiveness)","In some instances, data on government expenditure on education refer only to the Ministry of Education, excluding other ministries that may spend part of their budget on educational activities."

3185,Expenditure on education per student by level of education and source of funding,"SDG Indicator 4.5.4: Total initial funding from government (central, regional, local), private (households and other private) and international sources for a given level of education (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education) per student enrolled at that level in a given year. The results should be expressed (i) as a percentage of GDP per capita; and (ii) in PPP$ (constant). Unless an additional disaggregation is proposed, this indicator considers funding for public and private institutions together.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics.,"This indicator reflects the amount of resources invested on average in a single student, going beyond government sources so that an actual unit cost can be calculated. Using a per student basis is useful for comparison, whether between levels of education, over time, or between countries. Expressing the indicator either as percentage of GDP per capita, or in PPP$, also allows for comparisons between countries, and using constant values when looking at time-series is necessary to evaluate how real (eliminating the effects of inflation) resources are evolving over time.","The percentage of the total initial funding (i.e. including transfers paid but excluding transfers received) from government (central, regional, local), private (households and other private) or international sources for a given level of education (pre-primary, primary, lower secondary, upper secondary, post-secondary non-tertiary and tertiary education) out of the number of students enrolled at that level in a given year. The result is divided (i) by GDP per capita; and (ii) by the PPP$ conversion factor.","Central, regional and local government expenditure data on education by level of education and type of institution; household and (ideally) other private expenditure on education by level of education and type of institution; international expenditure on education by level of education and type of institution; number of students enrolled by level of education and type of institution.","At the national level, ministries of finance and/or ministries of education financial management systems are the source of government expenditure on education, although disaggregation by level often implies estimations using data on students and/or teachers by level. Data on expenditure by lower levels of government can be centralized or collected directly from local authorities.

Household expenditure on education is collected through consumption/expenditure surveys, although few surveys disaggregate spending by level of education, type of school and/or nature of expenditure. School censuses in some countries also collect data on financial/in-kind contributions by households/students.

To support the collection of high-quality data, the UIS and the World Bank (2018) have published a guidebook on designing and implementing household surveys that include measurement of expenditure on education. The guidebook provides a standardized set of guidelines to foster the harmonization of education-expenditure data in household surveys, and to ensure that the data collected are more easily comparable across surveys and countries and are sufficiently comprehensive while acknowledging country-specific needs.  Data on other private sources of funding for education (e.g. corporations, local NGOs) are rarely collected systematically and would often require additional surveys proceeded by significant analytical, preparatory and advocacy work.  International sources may be available through governmental financial systems when they are recorded on-budget, and off-budget international funding may sometimes be available through governmental aid management systems, although rarely with the disaggregation needed (ex. by level of education). Data sources for international funding, such as the OECD-DAC database or the International Aid Transparency Initiative (IATI) may be used as a complement, but often present problems of compatibility with other sources, such as government records.","By level of education, source of funding (government, private, international), type of institution (public/private) but with expected lower coverage for private institutions. For household expenditure, eventually disaggregation by wealth, location and sex could also be calculated, but not for government and international sources.","Government funding: When considered as a percentage of GDP per capita, a higher value would indicate a greater priority to the specific level of education given by public authorities. When considered in PPP$, the indicator can show the 'real' amount of resources invested in one student.

Private/household funding: a higher value would signify a greater burden on households, and potential implications for equity and access to education.  For international sources: a higher value would signify a greater commitment from donors to a level of education in a given country, but also potentially a greater degree of aid dependency for governments in terms of education funding.

For all sources combined: the indicator would show the real, total value of resources invested in one student, and therefore the real unit cost. Since the indicator is constructed on a comparable scale (i.e. for one student, and relative to GDP per capita or using a common currency), all its sub-components can be compared to other levels of education, over time, or between countries.

The UIS maintains a global database on enrolment and total initial expenditures by level of education, and defines the protocols and standards for data reporting by countries. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) produces and maintains data on GDP per capita and PPP constant $ conversion factor.","The difference between ‘initial funding’ (where the funds originally came from) and ‘final expenditure’ (which entity carries out the expenditure and sends the funds to the school) is important to clarify in this type of indicator. For example, where international donors transfer funds to the ministry of education budget without earmarking for specific activities (such as through sector budget support), the expenditure is done by the government, but the funding comes from international sources. Same thing with a scholarship: the initial funder is the government, and the final spender is the household. Either two sets of indicators should eventually be produced (potentially confusing to users), or a choice be made on which perspective will be presented. The option presented here (and to be discussed and validated) is to calculate the indicator on the basis of initial funding because a) This is arguably more intuitive--if we are saying 'by source of funds', people expect to see who paid and b) This would be better aligned with the National Education Accounts methodology. Note that if we go with that option, we may want to change the indicator name to something like “Education funding per student by level of education and source”.

 The part of this indicator focusing on government expenditure is already available for a large number of countries, although not always with regularity. The formula would also need to be slightly modified if we are to use initial funding.  For private and international sources, data availability is significantly lower, so that it will take several years and significant investment to increase coverage to an acceptable level. In the medium-term, ‘private’ expenditure may have to be limited to households only (and only for a few countries), and international sources to those recorded in government budgets.

The lack of data on household sources is especially important to consider when looking at expenditure in private institutions, where fees tend to be much higher."

Positive values of the indicator express higher inflow of students from abroad, while negative values depict the opposite.","Inbound and outbound international students mobility indicators should be calculated based on accurate and comprehensive enrolment data from all types of tertiary education institutions, including public and private.

 The UIS sets standards, develops questionnaires and quality control protocols for country data reporting, and maintains the global database on the structure of education and enrolment data in tertiary education by students’ country of origin and sex.","The accuracy of this indicator may be affected by a number of considerations. For example, a comprehensive enumeration of outbound mobile students may be challenging task if there is no systemic mechanism to track outbound students by country of destination, or if the host countries (universities abroad) do not report data on the international students by country of origin. Furthermore, the criteria used to define mobile students may vary from one country to another, which may affect the cross-country comparability of this indicator."
3250,"Education expenditure by source of funding as a percentage of GDP (public, private, international)","SDG Indicator 4.5.6: Expenditure on education (from public, private, international sources) expressed as a percentage of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a given financial year.  The indicator and sub-indicators are defined as follows:  1. Initial general government financing for education as a percent of GDP 2. Initial private sector household financing for education as a percent of GDP 3. Initial private sector non-household financing for education as a percent of GDP 4. Initial rest-of-world ODA financing for education as a percent of GDP 5. Initial rest-of-world non-ODA financing for education as a percent of GDP 6. Total initial financing for education as a percent of GDP 7. Total initial financing (from general government, households and ODA) for education as a percent of GDP The concepts used in this definition are defined in the National Education Accounts developed by UNESCO published in 2016 and are summarized here.  Financing unit (see UNESCO 2016b:22): The NEA defines financing units as “institutional units which provide financial resources to the domain” of education. The NEA distinguishes between financing units that finance education and producing units that provide education. These may be the same entity (e.g.: a ministry of education) but are considered separately in the NEA. The NEA offers the following categorization of financing units: (1) general government which includes all levels of government), (2) private sector, and (3) rest-of-world which includes external financing including those of international development partners. For the purpose of this proposal, private sector is split between households and non-households. In practice, the definition of households would need to vary by country and correspond to those from which expenditure data is collected. Rest-of world is also split between Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) which would follow the OECD definition and non-ODA. The choice to follow the OECD definition is also pragmatic given that the OECD CRA is the primary source of data on ODA flows.  Initial financing (see UNESCO 2016b:29): The NEA distinguishes between initial and final financing to reflect the fact that financing units can transfer funding among each other. Initial financing includes direct expenditure on education by a financing unit as well as transfers to other units that are earmarked for education. Initial financing excludes any transfers being received that are earmarked for education. The intent with initial financing is to understand how much of its financing it is, on its own accord, allocating to education.  Estimation method The UOE joint data collection collects all the information needed to calculate initial general government financing, initial private sector household financing, and ODA; however, in practice, coverage is generally low, particularly for household initial financing and for low and middle income countries. As a result, alternative data sources and methodologies are defined subsequently. The following methodology is based on the variable names described in UNESCO (2020) UOE Data Collection Manual 2020 and reflects definitions used by the OECD in OECD (2018). Note that the definition of initial general government financing corresponds to the definition used in the OECD’s (2018) Handbook for internationally comparable education statistics (see pp. 114).  See Table 1 UOE data sources and calculation method, Table 2 Non-UOE data sources and Table 3 Alternative data sources at  https://tcg.uis.unesco.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/09/Metadata_4.5.6.pdf  Finally, two total initial financing indicators are reported. The first, “Total expenditure on education as a percent of GDP” is the sum of the preceding five sub-indicators presented in Table 1. However, given that data availability for initial private sector non-household financing and initial rest-of-world non-ODA financing is limited, a second indicator is presented with the main data sources, “Total expenditure on education (excluding nonhousehold private financing and rest-of-world non-ODA financing) as a percent of GDP” is reported.  Note that for the current data version, initial general government financing as percent of GDP is reported only if it lies between 1 and 10 percent of GDP. All other sub-indicators are reported if they lie between zero and 10 percent of GDP.",UNESCO Institute for Statistics,"To assess the emphasis of public, private, international financing of education relative to the national economic wealth. The indicator reflects the commitment of public, private, and international to invest in human capital development.",,,,,,,"The indicator inherits any limitations related to the reporting of general government expenditure on education (UOE G20), see meta-data related to SDG 1.a.2 for education. Specific to this indicator and its methodology, the additional issues also exist. First, UIS uses the World Bank’s estimate of GDP which may result in different estimates of financing as percent of GDP depending on the denominator used by other reporting organizations. Second, ODA is defined as flows reported to the OECD’s CRS by definition of this indicator--this is because data on ODA that is not reported to the CRS is not easily available. Third, the use of household survey data sources to estimate total household expenditure on education is limited by the comparability of reported household expenditure across countries: these include differences in whether expenditure is collected for a specific child or the household as a whole, differences in the recall period, and differences in items included under education that households are asked to report on. These limitations are described in more detail in the 2021/2022 GEMR (UNESCO 2022:398) and in EFW 2022 (UNESCO and World Bank 2022:20). Finally, data on transfers from the households to government earmarked for education (e.g.: tuition fees paid to public universities) that are recorded on government budgets would result in double counting (e.g.: recorded as household expenditure but also as general government expenditure). Review of World Bank BOOST data reveals that the availability of this data is quite limited and for those where revenues to education ministries are available tend to be quite small.
